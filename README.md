# C programming and a little OS
This is my main study progress on C and OS from May/~12 to 6/11. I enrolled CS537 summer 21, but now I decide to quit it due to personal reason. I would like to finish this course but I feel this goes far from my current route, unless I plan to be a system engineer. But I still value what I've already learned and will save my progress here:
1. Basic C programming. (control flow, functions, I/O/ pointers/ dynammic memory)I first spent ~4 hours on this youtube video: [C Programming Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJgsSFOSQv0&list=PLxBfPu5VvHmtB8yNRWSVL1NzfIptgOTsr&index=1). Then I read this book: [C for Java Programmers](https://cs.rochester.edu/~ferguson/csc/173/c-for-java-programmers.pdf). I mainly saved my work in folder `tutorial`. I feel this is a better video but I haven't watched: [C refreshor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A58eDMe6hpI&t=11s).
2. Operating System 101. I learned basic def about process. I spent time working on p1(writing unix utility) and half of p2(using gdb and writing a shell). The work is in folder `cs537`.

I wish I have time to learn all of this course but I feel like I'm spending **most** of time working on stuff I won't use in my future career, so I don't have much motivation(maybe because myself).
